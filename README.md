## Installation

This simple extension can be easily installed in Chrome or Firefox. At this stage, I think it is best to use it without packaging.

### Google Chrome
You can use it as an unpacked extension.

 * Open `chrome://extensions` in a tab and enable Developer mode in the top right corner
 * Click `Load unpacked` and select the folder containing this repository
 * Open the eLog of any experiment

### Mozilla Firefox
You can use it as an add-on in debug mode.

 * Open the debugging extensions menu: `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
 * Select `Load temporary Add-on...` and select the `manifest.json` file in the repository.
 * Open the eLog of any experiment
